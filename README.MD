In this project, we create a scraper program that visits a Website and reads their page contents to collects certain information.

The main function of our scapper is to collect the product information of products being sold on Tiki, including products on every pages of all categories. The collected information will be saved as arrays, which will in turn be added into a Pandas dataframe.
